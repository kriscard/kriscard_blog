title: Callback function
description: What is a callback function?
---
I spent some time to try to understand what is a callback function. I always see different ways to use them, and sometimes I was a little bit confused about them. So let's try to understand clearly what do we mean by callbacks function.

**DEFINITION**

A callback function is a function we pass as a parameter inside another function to handle some specific task after the core element of the function is done. To be more precise, we can see the callback function as someone we pass inside a function to do some specific thing for us at a particular time.

Let's try to give a clear vision of this notion:

*I want to send my little brother to the grocery to buy some tomato sauce, eggs, and cheese to make a pizza, but I already know it will forget something on this list. So I ask his best friend, "Callback" to go to the grocery with him to make sure my little brother don't forget something from the list. When my little brother finishes doing the shopping for me, his best friend will check if something is missing something.*

Code sample

I hope this little example gives you a better vision about Callback function! Now, we know what a callback function is, so that will allow us to dig on Promises function in the next article.
