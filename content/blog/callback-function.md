title: Callback function
description: What is a callback function?
---
The callback function wasn't a simple concept to understand for me at the beginning. I think I was always confused about its definition. Thanks for the "Explain Like I'm 5" google research keywords to get a pretty simple explanation about callback function. So, I will try my best to clarify this concept. 

**DEFINITION**

A callback function is a function that we pass as a parameter inside another function to handle some specific tasks after the core element of the function is executed. 

To be more precise, we can see the callback function as an element we pass inside a function to do some specific thing for us at a particular time.

Let's me try to give you a clear vision of this notion:

I want to make a pizza for dinner tonight! I sent my little brother to the grocery for some tomato sauce, eggs, and cheese, but I already know he will forget something. So I asked his best friend, "Callback," to go to the grocery with him and make sure he doesn't forget something. When my little brother adds everything in the cart, "Callback" will check if something is missing something from the list.

I hope this little example gave you a better vision about what is a Callback function and how to use them.
